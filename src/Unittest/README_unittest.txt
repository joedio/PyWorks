This is the unittest suite for PyWorks.

It's intended for use by the PyWorks Development team to test new releases of PyWorks
and to assist new users of PyWOrks to understand how to use it, as well as how to use
Python. If you'd like to run the test suite yourself you can.

The individual test files are named in the form of: "PyWorks_xxx_unittest.py". 
To run a particular test case, type:
    jython -m PyWorks_xxx_unittest.rb

The test suite file is named: PyWorks_unittest_testsuite.py 
To run the entire suite of test cases, type:
    jython -m PyWorks_unittest_testsuite.rb

In either case scan the results for any failures.
